Hello, user!
This is Slush Puppy's Retime Tool, designed for precisely retiming speedruns down to the millisecond. Currently, this only works for videos hosted on YouTube.


To use this, first of all find the framerate of the YouTube video you want to retime. Right click the video and click "Stats for nerds", and at the start of the 3rd line (titled "Current / Optimal Res") there will be a resolution followed by @xx, where xx is the framerate of the video. Enter this into the Video FPS box.

Next, find the first frame of the run. By using the , and . keys, you can advance one frame at a time to find the exact point. When you have found it, right click and select "Copy debug info", then paste (Ctrl+V) it into the "Start frame" box.
Do the same for the end frame.

When you are done, the exact time of the run will be displayed in the box.


The "Modifier" box will add a certain amount of time to the result. This is especially useful for games with unusual timing methods like Super Mario 64, where the timer is always at exactly 1.33 seconds on the first frame the logo appears. Moderators could set the Start frame to this point and set the Modifier to 1.33.
